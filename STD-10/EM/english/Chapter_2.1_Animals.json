      "answer": "In the poem, humans are depicted as discontented beings who 'sweat and whine' about their condition. They are often unhappy and complain about their lives.

Animals live in the present moment, while humans are burdened by worries and desires."

      "question_id": 27,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "What are the 'tokens of myself' that the poet refers to? How do animals evince them?",
      "answer": "The 'tokens of myself' refer to the innate human virtues such as innocence, simplicity, contentment, kindness, and truthfulness. The poet suggests that humans once possessed these qualities but have lost them over time ('negligently drop them'). Animals, however, have retained these virtues. They 'evince' (show) them plainly in their possession by living simple, uncomplaining lives, free from the greed and hypocrisy that plague human society."

    {
      "question_id": 28,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Write an appreciation of the poem 'Animals' focusing on its theme and style.",
      "answer": "The poem 'Animals' by Walt Whitman is a free verse poem that critiques human society by comparing it with the animal world. The central theme is the loss of natural human virtues and the superiority of animals in preserving them. The poet admires animals for their calmness, self-sufficiency, and lack of greed. He uses simple language and a conversational tone. The poem lacks a rhyme scheme, which reflects the poet's desire to break away from traditional constraints, just as he wishes to break away from social conventions. Through figures of speech like Repetition and Alliteration, Whitman emphasizes the peace found in the animal kingdom versus the chaos of human life."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 29,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Explain the criticism of religious hypocrisy in the poem.",
      "answer": "Whitman criticizes the way humans practice religion by saying, 'They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God.' He implies that humans often make a show of their religion, talking endlessly about their duties and sins, yet remaining unhappy and dissatisfied. This behavior disgusts the poet. Animals, on the other hand, do not engage in such discussions or perform rituals like kneeling to ancestors. Their spirituality is lived through their natural, content existence, which the poet finds more genuine."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 30,
      "question_type": "LONG",
      "question": "Why does the poet feel more 'at home' with animals than with humans?",
      "answer": "The poet feels more at home with animals because he finds humans to be 'complicated and false'. Humans are ridden with guilt, greed ('mania of owning things'), and discontent. They are constantly complaining and striving for social status ('respectable'). Animals are the opposite: placid, self-contained, and free from the burden of sins or material desires. They possess the basic virtues that humans have carelessly lost. This simplicity and authenticity of animals make the poet desire their company over that of humans."

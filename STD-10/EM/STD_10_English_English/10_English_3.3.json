      "answer": "As ALS progressed, Stephen Hawking's physical abilities declined, and he eventually lost his ability to speak following a tracheotomy. To communicate, he relied on advanced technology. He used a specially designed computer program attached to his wheelchair. By using a cheek muscle to control a cursor on a screen, he could select words and phrases. These were then converted into speech by a voice synthesizer. This technology was vital, allowing him not only to communicate with people in his daily life but also to write books, give lectures, and continue sharing his scientific ideas with the world."

His life became incredibly difficult at a young age when he was diagnosed with a progressive, debilitating disease and given a grim prognosis. Facing complete paralysis and the loss of speech, it would have been easy to give up. However, he chose to focus on what he *could* still do – use his brilliant mind. He succeeded spectacularly in theoretical physics, becoming one of the most celebrated scientists of his time.

      "question": "Expand the idea in the following quote: 'However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you just don't give up.'",
      "answer": "This quote emphasizes resilience and the power of human agency amidst adversity. Life often presents seemingly insurmountable challenges that can lead to despair. However, the quote suggests that no matter how dire the circumstances, individuals possess inherent abilities and potential. There is always some avenue for action, some goal, however small, that can be pursued and achieved. The key is not to succumb to hopelessness but to maintain a persistent effort. Success isn't defined by the absence of difficulties but by the refusal to be defeated by them. It's a call to focus on possibilities rather than limitations and to keep striving, for effort itself is a victory."

      "question": "Discuss the role of support systems (family, technology, institutions) in Stephen Hawking's success based on the text.",
      "answer": "While Hawking's individual brilliance and determination were paramount, support systems played a crucial role. His family, particularly his wife Jane Wilde, provided emotional stability and a reason to live after his diagnosis, which was a turning point. Academically, institutions like Oxford and Cambridge provided the environment and resources for his research, with the Royal Society recognizing his work. Crucially, as his physical condition deteriorated, technology became his lifeline. The computer and voice synthesizer enabled him to communicate, write, and lecture, allowing his intellect to continue impacting the world long after his body failed. These support systems were essential enablers of his continued success."
